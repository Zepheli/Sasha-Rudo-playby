A small girl (4'10") with light blue hair that life wasn't kind to.

Physically quite weak, her body falls ill quite easily, and she often wears a veil to try and mitigate this. Perhaps she does it to cover up damage done to her face through disease, as well.

She has stayed at home a lot in her life, but recently, she has been learning water magic to try and heal her frail constitution. She has turned out to be quite good at it.

Thankfully, her brother, Cain Rudo, has been there for her. She wouldn't know what to do if not for him.
